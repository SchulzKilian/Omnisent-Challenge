I took a lot of "artistic freedom" with the limited time I had for this task.

In a real world scenario I would like to discuss there things with a team first. 
- the fact that I only show the radius for sensors that have spotted something
- my way of replaying past events (user friendly, but maybe not if the event lies far back)
- the decision to use dart/flutter over classic frontend frameworks such as react (thought maybe the sensors could be checked from mobile, plus i know flutter fairly well)
- i made it so the sensors cant be set dynamically via api or similar, since this should be something fixed by us at installment time im guessing, instead of available on the client API



Those are some of the major challenges on which I considered tradeoffs.
